    <p style="text-align: center;">
I know your eyes in the mornin' sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn (I really mean to learn)
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Na-na-na-na-na)
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Na-na-na-na-na)
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
